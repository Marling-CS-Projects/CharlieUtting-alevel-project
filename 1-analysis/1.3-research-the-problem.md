![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

Project Zomboid is an open world survival game where you have to survive in a zombie apocalypse for as long as they possibly can. Released on the 8th of October 2013, it is on it can run on Windows, Linux, and OS X. Its perspective is third person and top down and is similar to a dungeon crawler as it uses field of view dependent on light.

### Controls

The game is on the PC so uses the keyboard and mouse, using W to move forward(in the direction of the mouse), A to move to the left of the mouse, D moves the player to the right of the mouse, and S moves the player downward/away from where the mouse is. Other things keys that have a function are CTRL to crouch, shift makes you sprint, and E is interact and to perform. When you press E rapidly you perform an act urgently like smashing a window with your arm.

### Gameplay

#### Player customisation

At the start of the game you can customise the appearance of your character and you also have to pick abilities and disadvantages which have to balance to make the game have more challenge whilst also making it have perks for the player which can be used to negate the difficulty and will make the game different every time you play it and give it multiple play styles for the player to try and master.

#### Top down perspective

The top down perspective of the game makes the game easier to see the zombies and can be attacked and it makes it easier to have darkness and field of view like in a dungeon crawler. It also makes the game have more planes to traverse other than left and right but still have the game with 2D assets like in pok√©mon games.

#### Zombies and structure destruction

The game's main challenge is the zombies who can also break through doors or windows when it becomes aware of your presence through making a noise or them seeing you and then will continue to pursue and other zombies are able to go through the same cleared route as the one made by the last. This makes the difficulty of the game more consistent as you cant just hide in structures to be able to escape the zombies and makes it more imperative that you do not create noise without good reason and checking your surroundings.

#### Online

The game has an online mode in which a player can invite their friends to play and survive with them. The server size is up to 100 people and you can both host and join servers. It also has multiplayer in split screen. You can also toggle the ability to fight with players in the server.

#### Defences and vehicles

The game also has a sandbox survival game which allows the player to build barricades and craft items to survive. This also includes the construction of buildings as well. There are also vehicles in the game which is used to traverse the game map quicker and to escape zombies.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Structures breaking   | I think this is essential to provide the game with some difficulty and will prevent players from just running inside to hide from zombies.                                                                               |
| Colors                | The game is very gloomy and I want to replicate this in my game as it will add to the fear of the player about the zombies.                                                                                              |
| Top-down perspective  | I think this will give the game more exploitability and challenge as you can explore North, South, East, and West in stead of just left and right and up and down like in 2D games like Terraria.                        |
| Zombies               | I will include zombies which will be the main enemy in my game as it is in Project Zomboid.                                                                                                                              |
| Tracking              | The zombies in Project Zomboid track the player instead of just following a pre-made path and this is what I want to achieve in my game.                                                                                 |
| Building blockades    | I will include this as it will allow people to fortify structures and temporary structures and therefore be able to collect items in the game as it will be able to create more time as they will have to break through. |

| Feature              | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Online               | I think this could make the game to easy for some players which could defeat the point as, if they join a server that has been used for a while, they may be able to complete the game without much trying. |
| Player customisation | This will be too long to add and will not improve the game much as it will not be very visible in the 2D style.                                                                                             |
| Structure building   | There are already going to be pre-made structures in the game which can be fortified by the player but being able to build whole structures will be too easy and fortification will be enough.              |
| Mini-map             | This will make the game too easy for the player as I want them to have to remember routes in the game rather than just refer to a sat-nav like image that they can access at any time.                      |

## Terraria&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

Terraria is a 2D survival game with a camera from the side where you can traverse left and right. The game has a number of bosses and has mining to gain minerals to craft tools and armour and you can collect wood from trees and forage for other things. The game was released on the 16th of May 2011 and has been released on the mobile, PC, Playstation and XBOX, and Nintendo Switch.

### Controls

![Joy-Con controllers](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png>)

Terraria supports many platforms so has many types of control the game. It is on Nintendo Switch which uses two Joy-Con controllers which work similarly to a console controller as it has 2 joysticks on either side and buttons in similar places. The nintendo switch screen is also touch screen.

### Gameplay

#### Armour and Weapons

At the start of the game you can customise the appearance of your character and you also have to pick abilities and disadvantages which have to balance to make the game have more challenge whilst also making it have perks for the player which can be used to negate the difficulty and will make the game different every time you play it and give it multiple play styles for the player to try and master. There are over 500 weapons in the game, multiple of have magic abilities.

#### Side View

The perspective is a side scroller which looks at the 2D player from the a set distance and then follows the player like in a platformer game like Mario.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)

#### Bosses

The games main objective is to defeat the bosses including things like the Eye of Cthulhu which is a huge flying eye with teeth and has a 33.33% chance that it will spawn at the start of the night if the certain parameters are met like if the player has over 200HP. It can also be summoned and if the player does not defeat it by the end of the night it will disappear. When the eye dies it drops one of two types of resources which can be used to make armour or weapons which is the reason people fight it.

#### Online

Terraria is also online and can have around 8 players online at a time. It also has split-screen. Players can either choose to fight each other or work together as it has the ability for PvP.

#### Building

Terraria has more complex building which allows you to build big structures like houses that are permanent and keep the player safe as it is impossible for most things to break through. Some bosses can break the blocks placed to make these structures like the Eye of Cthulhu.

#### Crafting

Terraria allows the player to craft a variety of armour, weapons, and tools which give you positive affects and protect you from enemies. You can also craft certain blocks and decorations for your base which can be used for making the base look better or can be used to protect the player, for example the player can craft doors to stop enemies from getting in.

#### Terrain Generation

In Terraria, when a new game is created the game generates a unique terrain, which the game calls a world, with biomes and auto generated structures. World generation is decided by a seed which is a random set of numbers that are generated when the player creates a new world. You can also manually enter a certain seed to get the same world that was generated in the game you are creating. The game allows you to pick the size of the world that is generated from the sizes normal tiny, small expanded, medium, and large with the large world being 16800 x 480 feet in the game.

#### Saving

This game has a good saving process where when you quit the game the game will be saved and when the player comes back to the game they will have the option to continue playing the game that they created previously. This is a good system as the player does not have to worry to much about saving themselves but it also means that if you do not want to save the progress you made to that instance game you are forced to by the game.

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bosses   | This is a good way of progression and it adds an objective to the game other than survival and the items taken from the boss will make the player play for longer.                                              |
| Crafting | I think crafting will be useful as players will be able to make defences. This will also make the player able to create armour and weapons which can be used to defeat the bosses that are a harder difficulty. |
| Enemies  | I terraria there are multiple types of enemies. In my game I will make multiple classes of zombies which will give more variety to the game in different areas with different difficulties.                     |
| Saving   | In my game I will use saving but I will not use automatic saving and it will be the job of the player to manually save so I am taking the saving feature but not fully.                                         |

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Buildings creation | I will not allow the player to build a whole building as the point of the game is that they can fortify the already made buildings and can't make bases that are too big.                                        |
| Side-scrolling     | I want my game to be top-down like in Project Zomboid as I think that a side-scroller game makes the game too linear as the map only extends left and right not 4 directions like with the top-down perspective. |

## Deadlight <a href="#project-zomboid" id="project-zomboid"></a>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (2).png>)

### ‚ÄãOverview

Deadlight is a side-scrolling zombie survival game released on the XBOX and on windows by Microsoft. It was released on the XBOX-360 in August 2012 and published on PC in October. The game was made as a homage to early side-scrollers. You play as a former park ranger in the 1986, which is over 100 days since patient zero became infected and created all of the zombies which are called "shadows" in the game, who is trying to find his family in the zombie apocalypse There are also vigilantes who have established them selves as the 'New Law'.

### Controls

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png>)

The game is on XBOX so uses a XBOX-360 controller with two joysticks, the left joystick is used for movement and if you press the right bumper button he sprints, 4 face buttons(A to jump, B to access the axe you get at one, X to move heavy objects, and Y) which are used for attacking and interacting with things in game.

### Gameplay

#### Vigilantes <a href="#zombies-and-structure-destruction" id="zombies-and-structure-destruction"></a>

Other than the Zombies the game has another group of enemies who claim to be vigilantes. They have a camp which you have to infiltrate at one point in the game and they catch you in another mission. In the story the vigilantes are an armed militia and promise people safety within their stronghold. In one of the missions in the game you have to save a women who is being mistreated in their care after they promised she would be looked after.

#### Town

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

The game is set in a suburban area and the challenges that the game presents are using elements of the town and uses this is in the things like puzzles. For example the player can stand on cars to avoid zombies and they can travel in enclosed areas of the city to avoid the zombies and this is shown in the first image of the game and the one in this section.

#### Level design

This game is not an open-world(meaning completely unlimited exploration in the map) and the player is forced to play the story in the order the game intended and the only thing that the player can do is main story objectives. This means that the game is much more to the point, simple, and easier to pick-up.

| Zombies  | This game also has zombies which is a feature that I will be including in my game. The enemies will behave in a similar way as they do in this.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Town     | The environment of the game being in a town and the uses of the elements of the town is a more interesting setting for the player to play through                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Levels   | My game will not be fully open-world but will include some open world elements like some exploration sections of the map and the levels will all be accessible from the start but the player will be forced to play in a level structure which will be enforced by difficulty instead of physical game boundaries. |

| Cut scenes                | I do not want cutscenes(in game story scenes) in my game as it will mean that I would have to hire animators/artists and voice actors and can use other methods to progress the story.            |
| Linear levels             | This game has a very linear structure which completly stops the player from exploring which I will not be doing.                                                                                  |
| Ending that ends gameplay | After the player finishes the objective of the game in Deadlight but in my game you will be able to continue to play the game and just play a survival game after the story section has finished. |
| Story                     | This will be unnecessary for my game as the and will only take up time. Also game progression can be prompted in other ways.                                                                      |
