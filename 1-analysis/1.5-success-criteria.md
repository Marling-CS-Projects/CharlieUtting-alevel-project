|     1    | The map should have a bottom layer which has the road layout and other things that the player can walk over. This should have clear different parts to represent the road and make the setting of the game clear.                                               | This will be where the player is able to walk through to navigate the game.                                                                                                   | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     2    | The second layer of the game will have things that are built on top of the floor and will mostly be made up of things that the player cannot pass through like walls. This should be noticeably different from the bottom layer so it is easy to differentiate. | This will make it so the player cannot go through things that are supposed to be solid.                                                                                       | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     3    | The final layers will be object layers that will consist of certain types of objects with different properties like bushes or iron.                                                                                                                             | This could make the game have some interactivity and will again make the game look more realistic.                                                                            | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |

Each road will have a different level of difficulty.                                                                                                                                 | This will allow the player to explore the map whilst keeping it small enough to be efficiently loaded.                                                                        | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     5    | The roads that are further from where the player will spawn will be harder to beat as there will be more zombies.                                                                                                                                               | This means that the player will get a proficiency for the game in the easier areas and get better weapons and then be able to beat the sections they could not at the start.  | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Project<br>Zomboid</a></p> |

|     9    | The game will need a sight which will follow the mouse of the player.                                              | This will mean that the player will be able to aim where they want to fire.                                                                                               | [Controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|    10    | The player should be able to fire at the position of where the mouse is. The bullets should damage the zombies.    | This will mean that the player will have a weapon and can kill the zombies.                                                                                               | [Controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |

|    12    | The player's movement will use the W, A, S, and D keys or the arrow keys.                                          | This will allow the player to move around the map to play the game.                                                                                                       | [Controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|    13    | The game will be top down meaning that the user will be looking down at the game like a floor plan.                | This will mean that the game is easier to see where the enemies are coming from and where make the game feel like a town.                                                 | [Top Down](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |

### Non-Functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 19       | The game will have no sexual references and minimal depictions of graphic violence.                     | This will keep the game suitable for the greatest age range.

| 22       | The game should perform well(the game should have a high frame rate and should have low loading times). | This will increase the playability of the game as it is more fun if the game is more responsive and loads faster.                                       | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md)         |

| 24       | The map should be set in an a town.                                                                     | This will mean that the game makes sense to why there are so many zombies there and it  will make it more like the typical zombie movie.                | [Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)            |
| 25       | The game should outline its objectives.                                                                 | There should be some type of tutorial that the player sees at the start of the game which will tell the player what the objectives of the game will be. | [Tutorial](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)          |
