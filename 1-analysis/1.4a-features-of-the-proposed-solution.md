# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

This section will outline the features that I want to include in my game. This will be split into three sections of the features that are essential, the features that will be purely visuals, and the features that are not essential for the game to function but I want to include in the game.



## Game Design and Graphics

### Design

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

My game will have a pixelated art style like in the picture above as it gives the zombies have contrast from the surroundings and the game will have a more retro style.  I will use a lot of dark green which promotes fear, purple which triggers disgust, and some dark blue which creates sadness([Joosten, Van Lankveld and Spronck, 2010](../reference-list-features-of-proposed-solution..md)) to make my game feel somber and serious.  The game will be set in a town as this will make the setting make sense for why there so many people are zombies and it will be more like a zombie movie.

### Map Design

The map needs to be so that the player has space to explore.  I can use a map editor to design a map which will have preloaded building, with some level of destruction of things like windows and doors, and to create places for bosses/harder enemies to be for the player to have to confront for the story to continue and get better items.  Every new game the user makes all of the items found in the map will be randomised.  The map will consist of multiple layers for loading the location for different things.  There will be a below layer, a solid/world layer, an above layer, and an object layers.  The below layer will have the part the player will walk on like the road, the world layer will have buildings and things the player can't walk through, the above layer will have roofs, and the object layers will contain some of the objects like bushes and other similar parts of the map.

### Top-down Camera View

The game's perspective will be above the player looking down which shows more of the map around the player which will give the game a more realistic feeling and make it less linear as you can explore the map in greater detail as you have East, West, North, and South which are explorable which is more preferable than the side-scrolling view as you can only explore left and right and the up and down is limited by gravity.

## Game Mechanics and User Interface

### Controls

Because the game will be a web game, it will be focused on supporting PCs and MACs.  Due to this, the game's controls will use the keyboard and mouse which are the most common way of controlling computers.  It will use the W, A, S, and D layout for movement and other keys to interact with the world like E to interact with things in the environment like getting in a car and I to open inventory.  The mouse will be used to select things in the menus and in your inventory.

### Collisions

The game will have to detect for collisions as this will be the main way of determining player damage by zombies and other enemies in the game.  This will also apply to vehicles if they are crashed as they will have durability which will go down when the vehicle has collided with something and will therefore limit how long the player can use the vehicle for.

### Crafting

You will be able to craft things in the game with materials you find in the map.  You will be able to combine these materials into other things like weapons in the house you spawn in which will be the players base.

### Vehicles

I want the player to have the ability to travel the map with vehicles, like cars and vans, that will have been abandoned in the zombie apocalypse.  I will also need to display the speed the car is going with a speedometer as part of the user interface.  Vehicles will also require acceleration to make them feel more realistic and this will require some calculations.

### Camera Tracking and Shooting

My game has two options from being a top down perspective shooting game. I can either have the camera settings that follow the player and have the point of the mouse move around the player and be where the bullets fly to or I can have the sight be the centre of the screen and have the map and player both move around the mouse that stays static in the centre of the the screen. Because of the other aspects of my game other than the shooting I have chosen to have the player constantly be in the centre of the screen and have the sight move around it so that the focus is on the player and not only on the shooting aspect and allows you to do things like picking up items more easily.

## Functionality

### Saving Progress

As this game is a survival game with a story the player will want to be able to save their progress through the story and the amount of things they have collected and built.  This means saving will be a crucial feature of the game as otherwise the player will have to complete the story without any breaks and will have no incentive to build any long lasting defences against the zombies as they will not be able to keep them.

### Menu

The game will also need a menu which you will be able to load saved game data, start a new game, save game data, quit the game, and change game option(for example changing the functionality of buttons).  The menu will appear when you start the game and you can pull it up by pressing the esc key to be able to save the game.

### Tutorial

There should be a part of the game that outlines the objectives of the game so that the player has a clear understanding of what they have to do in the game but without it detracting from the difficulty of the game. This means that I will have to tell the player the bare minimum about playing the game like the controls and the main progression of the game but not about the difficulty increasing or other aspects of the game.

## Limitations

### Game Performance

Because the game's platform is web-based I will be limited in changing the performance of the game and it will be decided by the amount of RAM that the browser the user is using is limited to.  Due to most browsers being limited in the amount of RAM and other hardware limits I will have to consider this while making the map and other things that might be too difficult to run for some browsers.

### Map Size and Art

Because the amount of time creating this game is limited, I will not be able to properly make the map as big as I would like and I will not be able to spend much time on designing how it looks which will also apply for the players avatar.

### Platforms

The game will not be able to support many platforms because I am designing it to be web-based which will mean the majority of players will be on a computer and using keyboard and mouse, and I am focusing on the functionality of the game and due to the short time limit will not be able to create support for other platforms.

### Story Length

Again, due to the time limit I will not be able to make the story very long or spend much time on the game design of the story or the bosses and will mostly be focusing on making the game  functional in the time limit.
