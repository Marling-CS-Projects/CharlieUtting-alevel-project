# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Demographics

The most important demographic in my opinion is age as most people share characteristics and preferences with people who are a similar age to them and using this is the simplest way to work out who would be interested to play my game. In the U.S. 20% of people who play video games are under 18 and 34% are between the ages of 18 and 34 which is larger than the age group above it which is 35 to 44 years as the percentage who play video games in that age group is only 14% of the US's gamers which is 20% point drop from the younger age group. After this the percentages continue to drop([Clement, 2021](../reference-list-stakeholders.md)). This means that the age group with the largest percentage of people who play games is 18 to 34. US video game sales show that the most popular genre of game is action at 26.9% of game sales and the fifth most popular is adventure with 7.9% of game sales in the US([Clement, 2017](../reference-list-stakeholders.md)) which means that my game will capture both the most bought and fifth most bought game genres. PEGI(Pan European game information) is the system adopted by Europe to age rate video games including both difficulty and inclusion of violent content, as my game will include zombie characters which the player will be required to fight I believe the game will fall into the 12 category as it is violence against a human looking fantasy character, but as the game is 2D and will contain unrealistic depictions of the violence I think it will not go into the 16 category. It would also be a 12 as it depicts creatures that most younger children would find scary so would also have the fear label([PEGI, 2017](../reference-list-stakeholders.md))

This will mean that it will take advantage of the largest demographics. It will be suitable for this audience because the older audience will be disinterested with a game aimed for children(as a game like this will lack challenge and an interesting premise) and therefore the biggest audience of 18 to 34 year-olds will be interested but so will the largest part of the under 18 section of the video game audience([Clement, 2021](../reference-list-stakeholders.md)).

As identified in my problem identification effectence motivation and difficulty and how unforgiving the game death is a major part of attracting certain types of players. Seeing as my game will already be a PEGI 12 I think that the difficulty should therefore be greater to appeal to an audience that is slightly older and most able which should be from 18 to 34 but would still include some of the under 18 as it would require would be higher reaction times, as the age group 18 to 29 have a reaction time of 402 ms which is the lowest of all age groups([Janacsek, Fiser and Nemeth, 2012](../reference-list-stakeholders.md)), and being able to learn quicker and have a better ability for problem solving and perseverance that would only be possessed by an older age group from around 14 to 15 years old and up. My game will also fall into the action category due to it being fast paced and with high stakes(death) and therefore this game will capture the market for one of the most popular game genres.
