# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope that I can make the map to have an actual structure and make the player collide and interact with it.

* [x] Make buildings on the map.
* [x] Add collide property to buildings.
* [x] Make the player collide with things that have the collide property.

### Usability Features

* Colours - The different layers of the map should be easy to distinguish between and have a high colour contrast so the player can see clearly where they are moving in the map.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| worldLayer    | This is the layer that holds the buildings and other things that are placed on top of the ground/lower layer of the map.       |
| collides      | This is a boolean which you define when you make the map and then you use it to define what will be colliding with the player. |

### Pseudocode

```
create(){
...
    define belowLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    define worldLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    
    set collisions by property worldLayer({collides: true})
    
    physics add collider between(worldLayer, player)
...
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

In my main javascript file I defined the worldLayer as a static layer and created the collision property and this allowed me to make the player collide with the walls.

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">function create(){
    //...
    
    //Create the lower and world layers of the tilemap
    belowLayer = map.createLayer("Lower", tileset, 0, 0);
    worldLayer = map.createLayer("World", tileset, 0, 0);
    
    // Set collision on tiles in the world layer that have
    //the 'collides' property set to true
    worldLayer.setCollisionByProperty({collides: true});
    
<strong>    //Add a physics collider between the player and the
</strong><strong>    // world layer, so that the player will collide with
</strong><strong>    //tiles that have the 'collides' property set to true
</strong>    this.physics.add.collider(worldLayer, player);
    //...
}
</code></pre>

### Challenges

My main challenge was with the collisions as it was not working and the collisions where being detected but was not preventing the objects from going through each other. The reason was to do with the way that I set up the project and I had to restart the project and take over the code.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                                                                   | What actually happens          | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                      | The map appears with the worldLayer(walls) on top of the belowLayer.                            | As expected                    | Pass      |
| 2    | Walk the player into the wall | The player stops moving as they have hit the wall and are not able to go into the solid object. | As expected after a few tests. | Pass      |
