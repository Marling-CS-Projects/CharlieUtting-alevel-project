# 2.2.10 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to make the zombies interact with the player.

* [x] Display the players coordinates on the map so that I can change where things spawn.
* [x] Make the zombie face the player.
* [x] Make the zombie move toward the player.
* [x] Make the zombies take the player's health.
* [x] Add a cooldown that means the player's health cannot be reduced all at once when the zombie stays in contact with the player. Make the cooldown variable part of the class so each zombie has an individual cooldown variable.
* [x] Spawn in an amount of zombies randomly on the map.
* [x] Add health for the zombies that reduces when the zombie is hit by a bullet.
* [x] Have zombies die after their health reaches 0.
* [x] Display the players health on the screen.

### Usability Features

* Text - The health text should be clear in what it is displaying and should be visible from the game beneath it.
* Cooldown - This means that the game is more challenging for the user and makes more sense than before because it used a cooldown which applied to all of the zombies and it did not increase the rate when there were multiple enemies which isn't logical because they should be able to hit you at the same time.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| coords        | The variable for the text that will display the coordinates of the player. This will allow me to determine where to spawn the zombies and where to change the player's spawn to.                                                                         |
| zombie        | The variable that will store the individual zombies when they are created.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| zombies       | Group of sprites with physics for the zombies to be a part of. This will mean that I can make colliders for a whole group of sprites like in the iron cycle.                                                                                             |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| i             | This is the variable that will be used in the for loop to compare the amount of zombies(i) to the amount that is wanted.                                                                                                                                 |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once. Their will be a variable for each zombie so that if you are in contact with more than one they will take your health at a greater rate. |
| h             | health variables for the individual zombies.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| damage        | The amount of health that will be removed from the zombies when they are hit by a bullet. This will be doubled when the ironGoal variable is met and was first initialised earlier.                                                                      |

### Pseudocode

```
define damage = 20
define coords
define text2
define zombie
define zombies
define health = 100

class Zombie extends sprite{
    define cooldown = false
    define h = 100
    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture)
    }
    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);
    }
}
```

```
create{
    ...
    text2 = addText(20, 40, "Health:" health,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    coords = addText(20, 40, `X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    zombies = physics.group
    for (define i = 0; i < 50; i++){
        zombie = new Zombie(numberBetween(0,1784), numberBetween(0,1784), zombieImg)
        add zombies(zombie)
    }
    
    zombies.child{
        child.CollideWorldBounds=true
    }
    collider(zombies,zombies)
    collider(zombies,worldLayer)
    collider(zombies, player, takeDamage())
}

update{
    ...
    
    zombies.child{
        child.moveTo(player, speed:120)
        child.rotation=angle.betweenPoints(child, player)
    }
    
    set coords(`X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`)
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        ...
        collider(zombie, bullet, zomDie())
}

function zomDie(bullet,zombie){
    zombie.h = zombie.h - damage;
    
    destroy bullet
    if zombie.h <= 0 {
        destroy zombie
    }
}

takeDamage(){
    if zombie.cooldown == false{
        health = health - 3
        zombie.cooldown = true
        delayedCall(200, function cd(){zombie.cooldown = false})
        set text2(`Health: ${health}`)
    }
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import zomImg from './assets/zombie.png'
//...
let damage = 20
//...
let zombie
let coords;
let health = 100;
let zombies;
let text2;
//...
class Zombie extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {
    h = 100;
    cooldown=false;
    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture);
        this.scene.add.existing(this);

    }



    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);

    }
}
//...

function create{
    coords = this.add.text(20, 40, `X: ${player.x}Y: ${player.y}`, {
        fontSize: `20px`,
        fill: `#ffffff`
    })
    coords.setScrollFactor(0)

    text2 = this.add.text(20, 20, `Health: ${health}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    text2.setScrollFactor(0);
    //...
    zombies = this.physics.add.group({
        runChildUpdate: true
    })
    for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        zombie = new Zombie(this, Phaser.Math.Between(0, 1784), Phaser.Math.Between(0, 1784), 'zombieImg')
        zombies.add(zombie)
    }
    this.physics.add.collider(zombies, player, takeDamage, null, this)

    zombies.children.each(child => {
        child.body.collideWorldBounds = true;
    })
    this.physics.add.collider(zombies,zombies)
    this.physics.add.collider(zombies, worldLayer)
}
//...

function zomDie(bullet,zombie){
    zombie.h = zombie.h-damage
    console.log('zombie: ' & zombie.h)
    bullet.destroy(bullet.x, bullet.y)
    if(zombie.h <= 0){
        zombie.destroy(zombie.x,zombie.y)
    }
}

function takeDamage(player, zombie) {
    if (zombie.cooldown == false) {
        health = health - 3;
        zombie.cooldown = true;
        this.time.delayedCall(200, function cd(){
            zombie.cooldown = false;
        })
        text2.setText(`Health: ${health}`)
    }
}

function update (){
    zombies.children.each(child => {
        this.physics.moveToObject(child, player, 120)
        child.rotation = Phaser.Math.Angle.BetweenPoints(child, player)
    })
    //...
    coords.setText(`X: ${Math.round(player.x)} Y: ${Math.round(player.y)}`)
    //...
}
```

### Challenges

This cycle wasn't very difficult as it was mainly just implementing things that I had already done into the code again but for the zombies this time. For example the delay for the health had already been done before. The part that was most hard was making the zombies follow the player and face the player.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                                                                                                                                                              | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code             | There should be multiple zombies around the map. The player's health and coordinates should be displayed at the top right of the screen. The zombies should also look at the player and follow the player. | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 2    | Move the player      | The zombies should continue to look at the player and should move towards the new location of the player.                                                                                                  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run into the zombie. | You should collide with the zombie. The player's health in the top right should go down.                                                                                                                   | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 4    | Shoot the zombie.    | The zombie should disappear after 5 shots as the health is 100 and you inflict 20 damage(until the amount of damage is upgraded when you hit the ironGoal).                                                | As expected.          | Pass      |

### Evidence

This shows the health going down and the zombies being killed. It also shows the coordinates changing.
