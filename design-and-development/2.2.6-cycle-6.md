# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to make the iron intractable and to be able to finish the feature.

* [x] Make the iron disappear when the player collides with it.
* [x] Add to the ironCount variable when the player collides with the iron.
* [x] Update the text so that the players iron is displayed after the get it.
* [x] Add in a goal for the iron to hit and make the goal increase when it is met.
* [x] Add a damage variable for weapons later that will increase every time they get a new upgrade.

### Usability Features

* Controls - I have added in some new elements that have intractability. Picking up the iron should be simple and easy to understand the mechanic.
* Text - The text that displays the amount of iron should be clear and contrast the background so it is easy to understand.
* Objectives - The objectives of the game should be easily displayed with the text so that the user understands them.
* Iron - When the player plays the game it needs to be clear how they are supposed to interact with the iron as this will be the main functionality of the game and the way to progress.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ironGoal      | This is the variable that will store the amount of iron the player needs to upgrade their weapon. |
| ironGoals     | An array for all of the goals for the levels.                                                     |
| i             | Where the player is in the array.                                                                 |
| damage        | To store how much damage the player will do.                                                      |

### Pseudocode

```
define ironGoal = 6
define ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25]//amount of iron on each level
define i=0
let damage

create(){
...
    physicsAddColliderBetween(player, iron, collectIron())
    text = addText(570, 70, "Iron:" ironCount "/"ironGoal ,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    text setScrollFactor(0)
}
function collectIron(){
    destroy iron
    ironCount++
    if ironCount == ironGoal{
        i++
        ironGoal = ironGoals[i]
        damage = damage * 2
    }
    set text(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`)
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import ironImg from './assets/iron.png'

let ironGoal = 6;//The amount of iron that the player needs to collect when the game first starts is set to 6.
const ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25];//amount of iron on each level
let i = 0;//marks where the player is through the array above
let damage = 5;// Declaring the damage inflicted on zombies when they get shot as 5


function create(){
    //...
    //collider between the player and the iron that triggers a function when they collide.
    this.physics.add.collider(player, iron, collectIron, null, this)
    
    //adds text that displays to the player the amount of iron and the amount that they need to collect to progress.
    text = this.add.text(570, 70, `Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    text.setScrollFactor(0);
    //...
}
//The function that triggers when the player collides with the iron
function collectIron(player, iron){
    //destroys the iron
    iron.destroy(iron.x, iron.y);
    //increments the ironcount variable by one
    ironCount++
    //An if statement that if the ironcount is the same as the goal then the
    //marker for where the player is in the array of goals is increased by one
    //and then the new iron goal is taken from the array.
    //Then the players damage that the player deals is doubled.
    if(ironCount == ironGoal){
        i++
        //resets the iron count
        ironCount = 0;
        ironGoal = ironGoals[i];
        damage = damage*2;
    }
    //updates the text that shows the iron count and th goal
    text.setText(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`);
}
//...
```

### Challenges

This task was quite straight forward so the main challenge learning how to make the individual pieces of iron disappear and putting the function in the right order so that the text is updated correctly.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                | What I expect                                                                                  | What actually happens                                                                                                     | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                                    | The amount of iron and the ironGoal should be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. | As expected                                                                                                               | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the iron.                          | The iron should disappear and iron should be added to the ironCount.                           | It updated the text before it changed the iron count so the ironCount on the screen did not change. The iron disappeared. | Pass/Fail |
| 3    | Run into the iron.                          | The iron should disappear and iron should be added to the ironCount.                           | As expected.                                                                                                              | Pass      |
| 4    | Run into the amount of iron in the ironGoal | ironCount resets and the ironGoal changes next ironGoal.                                       | As expected.                                                                                                              | Pass      |
