# 2.2.1 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to be able to add in the iron element of the game.

* [x] Add text that displays the amount of the iron(the material that you need to collect to upgrade.
* [x] Add an object layer which contains iron.
* [x] Load in the object layer.
* [x] Make the player collide with the iron.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| iron          | This is the variable for the iron object which will have all of the properties in it.            |
| ironLayer     | This is the variable that will hold the layer exported from tiled with the iron in it.           |
| ironCount     | This is the variable to store the amount of iron the player has collected.                       |
| text          | This is the variable that will be used to display the text stating the amount of iron collected. |
| object        | This will hold the objects from the phaser tile map.                                             |
| obj           | This will have the individual iron in it.                                                        |

### Pseudocode

```
define iron;
define ironLayer;
define ironCount = 0;
define text;

create(){
...
    
    ironLayer = get object layer(name: iron)[objects]
    
    iron = newStaticGroup()
    
    ironLayer for each object=>{
        define obj = create(object X, object Y)//Object x and y are the positions in the tilemap.
        setScale obj(objectWidth/32, objectHeight/32)
        width obj body = objectWidth
        height obj body = objectHeight
    }
    physicsAddColliderBetween(player, iron)
    
    text = addText(570, 70, "Iron:" ironCount,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    text setScrollFactor(0)
...
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import ironImg from './assets/iron.png'

let iron;
let ironLayer;
let ironCount = 0;
let text;

function preload(){
//...
this.load.image('iron', ironImg);
}

function create(){
    //...
    ironLayer = map.getObjectLayer('Iron')['objects'];
    iron = this.physics.add.staticGroup()
    
    ironLayer.forEach(object => {
        let obj = iron.create(object.x, object.y, "iron");
        obj.setScale(object.width/32, object.height/32);
        obj.setOrigin(0,1);
        obj.body.width = object.width/2;
        obj.body.height = object.height/2;
        obj.body.setOffset(23,-6);
    });
    this.physics.add.collider(player, iron)
    text = this.add.text(570, 70, `Iron: ${ironCount}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    text.setScrollFactor(0);
    //...
}
//...
```

### Challenges

One of the challenges was with the hitbox (the solid part of the object) was not at the same point as the iron image and I had to add  the part of the code with the offset and I had to change the size of the hitbox as it was too large.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions       | What I expect                                                          | What actually happens                                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Run code           | You should be able to see the iron in the position that I placed them. | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the iron. | The player should be stopped as the iron is solid.                     | It did not as the hitbox was in a different place to the hitbox                                                                      | Fail      |
| 3    | Run into the iron. | The player should be stopped as the iron is solid.                     | As expected. The player can not pass through the image of the iron now as the hitbox has been moved to the correct place in the map. | Pass      |
