# 2.2.12 Cycle 12

## Design

### Objectives

In this I want to add in a tutorial to make the game easier to understand.

* [x] Display a text element for the tutorial.
* [x] Make the text disappear after a certain amount of time.

### Usability Features

* Text - It should be clear and contrast the background. It should disappear so that it does not disrupt the players experience especially when they reach the more difficult parts of the game later on.
* Tutorial - The tutorial will mean that the game is much more understandable to the user as it will tell them what the objectives of the game are which before where not as clear.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| tutorial      | This is the text variable for the tutorial. |

### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>...
</strong>define tutorial
<strong>...
</strong><strong>create{
</strong>    ...
    tutorial = addText(x, y, "Use the Arrow keys to move.
        Collect the iron.
        Use the mouse to aim and shoot.
        If you get the amount of iron in the top corner then it will upgrade your weapon.
        Your aim is to collect all of the iron in the map",{
        fontSize = 13px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    ...
}
...
update{
    delayedCall(10000, function tut(){tutorial visible = false})
}
...</code></pre>

### Outcome

```javascript
//...
let tutorial;
//...
function create{
    //...
    tutorial = this.add.text(320, 110, `Use the Arrow keys to move.\nCollect the iron.\nUse the mouse to aim and shoot.\nIf you get the amount of iron in the top corner then it will upgrade your weapon.\nYour aim is to collect all of the iron in the map`, {
        fontSize: '13px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    tutorial.setScrollFactor(0);
    tutorial.setOrigin(0.5);
    //...
}
//...
function update() {
    this.time.delayedCall(10000, function tut(){tutorial.visible = false});
    //...
}

//...
```

### Challenges

The main challenge was putting the text where I wanted it as it was hard to centre the text.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                    | What I expect                                                         | What actually happens           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                        | The text should now be displayed in the centre.                       | The text was not in the centre. | Fail      |
| 2    | Run code                        | The text should now be displayed.                                     | As expected                     | Pass      |
| 3    | Wait for the text to disappear. | The text should disappear with enough time for the player to read it. | It disappears but too quickly   | Pass/Fail |
| 4    | Wait for the text to disappear. | The text should disappear with enough time for the player to read it. | As expected.                    | Pass      |
