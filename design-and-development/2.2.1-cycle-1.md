# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

Make Phaser work and display something.

* [x] Run Phaser.
* [x] Create and export a tile map with Tiled.
* [x] Preload the tile set and the tile map.
* [x] Load in the map.

### Usability Features

* Colours - The colours should be contrasting so that the player can tell the difference between the different parts of the map and see where they are moving.
* Game Art - The game art should suit the games intended audience so should have a lot of [dark colours](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md). The game art should also convey what the sprite is so that the game is understandable. This will apply for all of the sprites and objects that I add for the game from now on.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config        | This object allows you to configure the game including the game window                                       |
| game          | Local variable which Phaser.Game is assigned to.                                                             |
| map           | This will be the variable will be used to load the appearance of the map that the player will be playing in. |
| tileset       | Variable that will load all of the textures that will be needed to load the map.                             |
| belowLayer    | The base layer for my map. I will create more when I have added more things like buildings and objects/      |

### Pseudocode

```
import Phaser

//Importing main code file.
import MainCode

define config
    width: 640,
    height: 480,
    physics: arcade,
    gravity: 0,
    scene: MainCode
    
define class MainCode
    
    constructor()
        super(key:MainCode)
    
    preload
        //preload tileset
        load image(tiles, adress of image in assets folder)
        load tilemap(map, address of map in assets folder)
    
    create
        define map = make tilemap(map)//uses the map from the preload
        //uses the name of the tileset file name and what you named it in the preload
        define tileset = add tileset(tileset name, tiles)
        
        define layer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
```

## Development

### Outcome

In main.ts I created the window with size and set the background colour of the window and other variables.  In PlayScene.ts I defined the variables needed to load the tile map like the map variable. In the preload function I loaded the image for the tile set and the tile map in json.

```javascript
//importing phaser
import Phaser from 'phaser'
//importing tileset and map
import tilesetImg from './assets/mytileset.png'
import tilemap from './assets/Map.json' 

//phaser game object
const config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 0 },
            debug: false
        }
    },
    scene: {
        preload: preload,
        create: create,
        update: update
    }
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);

function preload ()
{
    //preload tileset and tilemap
    this.load.image("tileset", tilesetImg);
    this.load.tilemapTiledJSON("map", tilemap);
}

function create ()
{
    //loading tilemap
    const map = this.make.tilemap({key: "map"});
    
    //loading tileset
    const tileset = map.addTilesetImage("mytileset", "tileset");

    //creating layers and linking to tileset
    const belowLayer = map.createLayer("Lower", tileset, 0, 0);
    const worldLayer = map.createLayer("World", tileset, 0,0);
    
    //creating spawnpoint
    const spawnPoint = map.findObject("Layer", obj => obj.name === "Spawn Point");

}
function update (){}
```

### Challenges

My main challenge was the fact that my camera would not spawn in the centre of my map so I could not tell if I had loaded my map correctly or if I had exported it from the Tiled map editor correctly.

I solved this by adding the variable 'spawnPoint' which finds the centre of the map so my view started in the middle of the map.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                        | What I expect                                                             | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run Code                            | When I go to the local host it displays my web-page.                      | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Display a background                | When the code is run It displays a black background for the window size.  | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Load tile map and tile set          | Have no errors about the memory address of the tile set and the tile map. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 4    | Set camera in the centre of the map | When loading the page it displays the  map that I created.                | As expected           | Pass      |
