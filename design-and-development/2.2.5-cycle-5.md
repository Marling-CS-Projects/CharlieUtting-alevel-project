# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to be able to add in the iron element of the game.

* [x] Add text that displays the amount of the iron(the material that you need to collect to upgrade.
* [x] Add an object layer which contains iron using the Tiled map editor.
* [x] Load in the object layer.
* [x] Make the player collide with the iron.

### Usability Features

There are no new usability features in this cycle.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| iron          | This is the variable for the iron object which will have all of the properties in it.            |
| ironLayer     | This is the variable that will hold the layer exported from tiled with the iron in it.           |
| ironCount     | This is the variable to store the amount of iron the player has collected.                       |
| text          | This is the variable that will be used to display the text stating the amount of iron collected. |
| object        | This will hold the objects from the phaser tile map.                                             |
| obj           | This will have the individual iron in it.                                                        |

### Pseudocode

```
define iron;
define ironLayer;
define ironCount = 0;
define text;

create(){
...
    
    ironLayer = get object layer(name: iron)[objects]
    
    iron = newStaticGroup()
    
    ironLayer for each object=>{
        define obj = create(object X, object Y)//Object x and y are the positions in the tilemap.
        setScale obj(objectWidth/32, objectHeight/32)
        width obj body = objectWidth
        height obj body = objectHeight
    }
    physicsAddColliderBetween(player, iron)
    
    text = addText(570, 70, "Iron:" ironCount,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    text setScrollFactor(0)
...
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import ironImg from './assets/iron.png'

let iron; // variable to hold the iron group
let ironLayer; // variable to hold the iron layer from the map
let ironCount = 0; // variable to hold the count of iron
let text; // variable to hold the text displaying the iron count

function preload(){
    //...
    this.load.image('iron', ironImg); // loading the iron image
}

function create(){
    //...
    ironLayer = map.getObjectLayer('Iron')['objects']; // getting the iron object layer from the map
    iron = this.physics.add.staticGroup() // creating a static group for the iron
    
    ironLayer.forEach(object => {
        let obj = iron.create(object.x, object.y, "iron"); // creating an object for each iron in the iron layer
        obj.setScale(object.width/32, object.height/32); // setting the scale of the object
        obj.setOrigin(0,1); // setting the origin of the object
        obj.body.width = object.width/2; // setting the width of the object's body
        obj.body.height = object.height/2; // setting the height of the object's body
        obj.body.setOffset(23,-6); // setting the offset of the object's body
    });
    this.physics.add.collider(player, iron) // adding collision between player and iron
    //adding text for the iron count
    text = this.add.text(570, 70, `Iron: ${ironCount}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    }); // creating a text object to display the iron count
    text.setScrollFactor(0); // set the text scroll factor to 0
    //...
}
//...
```

### Challenges

One of the challenges was with the hitbox (the solid part of the object) was not at the same point as the iron image and I had to add  the part of the code with the offset and I had to change the size of the hitbox as it was too large.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A picture in debug mode(shows hitboxes) that shows the original size of the hitbox and how far away it is from the iron image.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions       | What I expect                                                          | What actually happens                                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Run code           | You should be able to see the iron in the position that I placed them. | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the iron. | The player should be stopped as the iron is solid.                     | It did not as the hitbox was in a different place to the hitbox                                                                      | Fail      |
| 3    | Run into the iron. | The player should be stopped as the iron is solid.                     | As expected. The player can not pass through the image of the iron now as the hitbox has been moved to the correct place in the map. | Pass      |
