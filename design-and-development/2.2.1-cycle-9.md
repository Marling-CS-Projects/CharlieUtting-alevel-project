# 2.2.8 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to add bullets which will be the main weapon in the game.

* [x] Make a fix so that the player faces in the direction of the mouse in what ever position they are in the map as if you move it is looking at the coordinate of the mouse on the screen not on the map.
* [x] Spawn in bullets when the player presses the mouse
* [x] Make the bullets move towards the mouse position.
* [x] Reduce the delay when the ironGoal is met.

### Usability Features

* Controls - The mouse controls should be simple in terms of firing and aiming the weapon. The mouse controls should also work in all parts of the map.
* Colours - The bullets should be a bright colour that contrasts the map as this will allow the user to see projectile when it has a high velocity.
* Cooldown - This makes the game more logical again as it will be more realistic due to the fact that guns normally have some time in between firing.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| angle         | Stores the angle from the player to the mouse pointer on the map.                                                                                 |
| bullet        | The variable that will store the bullet game objects                                                                                              |
| control       | A boolean which states if the bullet can be fired.                                                                                                |
| delay         | The variable to store how long the player will not be able to fire after just firing and this can be changed when they progress through the game. |

### Pseudocode

```
define angle = 0
define bullet
define control = false
define delay = 600
function collectIron(){
    ...
    if ironCount == ironGoal{
        ...
        delay = (delay / 3)*2 //makes the delay 2/3 of what it was before.
    }
}

update(){
...
    angle = angleBetween(playerX, playerY, mousepointerWorldX, mousepointerWorldY)
    playerRotation = angle
    ...
    if mouse.isDown & control == false{
        bullet = physicsSprite(playerX, playerY, 'bulletImg')
        moveTo(bullet, mousepointerWorldX, mousepointerWorldY)
        
        control = true
        delayedCall(delay, function Bullet(){control = false})
        collider(bullet, worldLayer, destroyBullet(){destroy bullet})
    }
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import bulImg from './assets/bullet.png'

let bullet;
let angle = 90;
let control = false;
let delay = 600;

function collectIron(player, iron){
    //...
    if(ironCount == ironGoal){
        //...
        delay = (delay/3)*2
    }
    //...
}

function update (){
    //...
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        bullet = this.physics.add.sprite(player.x, player.y, 'bulletImg');

        this.physics.moveTo(bullet, this.input.mousePointer.worldX, this.input.mousePointer.worldY, 500)
        bullet.rotation = Phaser.Math.Angle.Between(player.x, player.y, this.input.mousePointer.worldX, this.input.mousePointer.worldY) - 80


        control = true;
        this.time.delayedCall(delay, function Bullet() {
            control = false;
        });
        this.physics.add.collider(bullet, worldLayer, function destroyBullet(){
            bullet.destroy(bullet.x, bullet.y)
        })
    }
}
//...
```

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was fixing the issue with the angles because I did not know the phaser syntax for the coordinate positions in the world/map.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                        | What I expect                                                                           | What actually happens                                                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                            | The player should be looking at the player's mouse.                                     | The player is not looking at the mouse at all now.                      | Fail      |
| 2    | Run code                            | The player should be looking at the player's mouse.                                     | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 3    | Move the mouse                      | The player should follow the mouse.                                                     | Now it looks at  the mouse at the start and stops looking at the mouse. | Fail      |
| 4    | Move the mouse                      | The player should follow the mouse.                                                     | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 5    | Move around the map.                | The player should face the mouse where ever they are on the map.                        | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 6    | Press the mouse button.             | A bullet appears and is moving towards the mouse's position when the mouse was clicked. | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 7    | Shoot at the wall                   | The bullet should disappear.                                                            | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 8    | Hold down the mouse button.         | The bullets fire continuously but a delay between each time it is fired.                | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 9    | Achieve the ironGoal and then fire. | The delay should be shorter.                                                            | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
