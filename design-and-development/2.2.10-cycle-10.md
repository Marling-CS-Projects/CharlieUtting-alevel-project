# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I will finish and improve the player experience while playing the game.

* [x] Change the font and change all of the text to bitmap text.
* [x] Add in a game over screen when the player dies.
* [x] Make the player invisible when the game ends.
* [x] Stop the physics when you loose the game.
* [x] Don't allow the player to be able to have their health displayed below 0.
* [x] Spawn in a boss when the player gets the max amount of iron. The boss will be part of the Zombie class and part of the zombies physics group.&#x20;
* [x] Make a variable for the zombie damage that goes up when the player reaches the boss so that it is harder to defeat the boss.

### Usability Features

* Text - The game over screen needs to improve the user experience by making the message clear for the player so that they are not confused. This will improve the user experience in the game.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| arcade        | This is the variable that holds the font that I am going to use for the game.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| gameOver      | The variable for the gameOver text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| boss          | This is the variable for the boss sprite that will spawn at the end of the game. This will be part of the Zombie class and will be in the zombies physics group.                                                                                         |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies and the boss.                                                                                                                                                               |
| i             | This is the variable that was used to mark the place in the array ironGoals.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once. There will be a variable for each zombie so that if you are in contact with more than one they will take your health at a greater rate. |
| h             | Health variables for the individual zombies and the boss.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| zomDam        | The variable that will store the amount of damage that the members of the zombies physic group will do.                                                                                                                                                  |

### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>define zomDam = 3
</strong>define boss
define gameOver

preload{
    ...
    load bitmapFont(arcade, address of font image in assets folder, adress of the font xml file in the assets folder)
}
</code></pre>

```
create{
    ...
    text = addbitmapText(x:390, y:20, font: arcade, `Iron: ${ironCount} out of ${ironGoal}`, size: 15)

    text2 = addbitmapText(x:20, y:20, font: arcade, `Health:$ {health}`, size: 15)
    
    coords = addbitmapText(x:20, y:40, font: arcade, `X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`, size: 15)

    gameOver = addbitmapText(x:320, y:240, font: arcade, `Game Over`, size: 50)

    gameOver visible = false
    ...
}
...
function collectIron(){
    ...
    set text(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`)
    if i == 5{
        boss = new Zombie(32, 1722, zombieImg)
        bossScale(x: 4, y: 4)
        add zombies(boss)
        zombie.h = 10000
        zomDam = 20
        health = 120
    }
    ...
}
...
function takeDamage(player, zombie) {
    ...
    if health <= 0{
        player visible=false
        physics = pause
        gameOver visible=true
        setText text2(`Health: 0`)
    }
}
...
```

### Challenges

The main challenge was importing the bitmap text as I had not used that part of phasers syntax before.
