# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to be able to make the map basically finished.

* [x] Have the player collide with the edge of the map.
* [x] Complete the map so that with all of the streets.
* [x] Add bushes to stop the player from being able to access all of the map.
* [x] Make player face mouse pointer.

### Usability Features

Controls - The mouse controls should be easy to understand and effective when playing.

Colour/Game Art - The barriers in the game should be easy to see so that the player realises that they are not able to go in certain directions.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| target        | This is the variable that holds where the player is aiming to face. |

### Pseudocode

```
define target;

create(){
... 
    player body collides with world bounds = true
    
    input on('pointermove', function (pointer){
        target = (Phaser angle between(player, mousepointer)
    })
}
update(){
    player rotation = target
    ...
    } 
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
//...
let target = 0; // Initialize variable target with 0

//...

//create function is called when the scene is first created
function create () {
    // set the main camera to follow the player, without smoothing
    this.cameras.main.startFollow(player, false);

    // set player's movement to be restricted to the boundaries of the game world
    player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;

    // listen to pointermove event and calculate the angle between player and pointer's position
    this.input.on('pointermove', function(pointer) {
        target = Phaser.Math.Angle.BetweenPoints(player, pointer);
    });
}

//update function is called on every frame of the game
function update () {
    // rotate the player towards the position of the pointer
    player.rotation = target;
}
    
```

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was setting the pointer value to change when the mouse moves. This was mainly because I did not know the syntax for phaser.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                               | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                      | The map to load with the parts that I added.                | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Move mouse                    | The player turns in the direction that I turned the mouse.  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run in to the edge of the map | The player to not be able to leave the map that I have made | As expected.          | Pass      |
