# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to add some functionality/interactivity to the game so I am going to add a controllable character.

* [x] Load in a player.
* [x] Make the player move with the arrow keys.
* [x] Set bounds for the camera.
* [x] Make the camera follow the player.

### Usability Features

* Controls - They should be easy to pick up and remember.
* Game Art - This does not apply here as all of the textures and the sprite that I am using are test textures but will continue to apply in the other cycles.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| player        | Variable to hold the sprite and the properties of the sprite. |
| cursors       | Adds the controls to the game.                                |
| camera        | What the player views.                                        |

### Pseudocode

```
create
    ...
    player = add sprite(x:100, y:100, name: player)
    cursors = create cursor keys
    camera set bounds(min x:0, min y:0, max x:map width pixels, max:map height pixels)
    camera follow player

update
    if left cursor is down then
        player x -= 5
    
    if right cursor is down then
        player x += 5
        
    if down cursor is down then
        player y += 5
    
    if up cursor is down then
        player y -=5
```

## Development

### Outcome

I did not have to change the main.ts file and made edits to the PlayScene.ts. In the preload I loaded an image for the player.  I created a player variable that created and loaded a sprite.  Then I made the cursor variable that means that the player can move with the instructions that I put in update.  I then set the camera boundaries and made the player collide with the side when it went too far

```typescript
//...
//defining global player and cursor phaser objects
let player;//These are defined here so that they are global variables and can be accessed in both the update and create functions.
let cursors;
//...
preload() {
        //...
        //preloading the player image
        this.load.image('player', '/assets/sprites/mushroom.png');
    }

    create() {
        //...
        //creating a player
        const player = this.add.sprite(100, 100, "player")
        
        //creating the keys that will be used for movement
        const cursors = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys()
        
        //setting bounds for the camera and making it follow the player
        this.cameras.main.setBounds(0, 0, map.widthInPixels, map.heightInPixels);
        this.cameras.main.startFollow(this.player, false);
    }


    update() {
        //When the arrow keys are pressed the player moves
        if (this.cursors.left.isDown) {
            this.player.x -= 5;
        }
        if (this.cursors.right.isDown) {
            this.player.x += 5;
        }
        if (this.cursors.down.isDown) {
            this.player.y += 5;
        }
        if (this.cursors.up.isDown) {
            this.player.y -= 5;
        }
    }
}

```

### Challenges

It was challenging as I was spawning not in the centre of the map and I thought that it had not loaded in.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                       | What I expect                                                          | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                                           | The sprite appears at the location I selected for it to spawn          | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press the arrow keys                               | The player moves up, down, left or right depending on the key pressed. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Move the player passed where the camera starts at. | The camera should follow the player.                                   | As expected           | Pass      |
| 4    | Move to the edge of the map.                       | The camera stops but the player continues towards the edge             | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence



![I made the map larger and the player loads in. The textures that I used were only for the development tests as I have not created the tileset yet and will not be used in the final version. The mushroom is the player and the walls in the background are the below layer.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)
