# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to add bullets which will be the main weapon in the game.

* [x] Change the coordinate that the player faces the mouse from the mouse coordinate relative to the screen to the coordinate the mouse is in on the map(because when you move the player's sprite is looking at the coordinate of the mouse on the screen not on the map).
* [x] Spawn in bullets when the player presses the mouse
* [x] Make the bullets move towards the mouse position.
* [x] Reduce the delay when the ironGoal is met.

### Usability Features

* Controls - The mouse controls should be simple in terms of firing and aiming the weapon. The mouse controls should also work in all parts of the map.
* Colours - The bullets should be a bright colour that contrasts the map as this will allow the user to see projectile when it has a high velocity.
* Challenge - The cooldown feature means that the game is more challenging for the player as they cannot fire many bullets at a time and this means that they will have to be careful when they are fighting.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| angle         | Stores the angle from the player to the mouse pointer on the map.                                                                                 |
| bullet        | The variable that will store the bullet game objects                                                                                              |
| control       | A boolean which states if the bullet can be fired.                                                                                                |
| delay         | The variable to store how long the player will not be able to fire after just firing and this can be changed when they progress through the game. |

### Pseudocode

```
define angle = 0
define bullet
define control = false
define delay = 600
function collectIron(){
    ...
    if ironCount == ironGoal{
        ...
        delay = (delay / 3)*2 //makes the delay 2/3 of what it was before.
    }
}

update(){
...
    angle = angleBetween(playerX, playerY, mousepointerWorldX, mousepointerWorldY)
    playerRotation = angle
    ...
    if mouse.isDown & control == false{
        bullet = physicsSprite(playerX, playerY, 'bulletImg')
        moveTo(bullet, mousepointerWorldX, mousepointerWorldY)
        
        control = true
        delayedCall(delay, function Bullet(){control = false})
        collider(bullet, worldLayer, destroyBullet(){destroy bullet})
    }
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import bulImg from './assets/bullet.png'

//Declaring the variables that I need. 
let bullet;
//sets the angle to 90
let angle = 90;
//control set to false at the start.
let control = false;
//adds a delay variable that will mean that the player fires slower
let delay = 600;

function collectIron(player, iron){
    //...
    if(ironCount == ironGoal){
        //...
        //when the player reaches the iron goal they will reduce the delay
        //for between bullets firing by a third.
        delay = (delay/3)*2
    }
    //...
}

function update (){
    //...
    //An if statement that checks if the player has pressed the mouse and
    //checks if the control variable is false which it is declared as at the
    //start.
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        //A bullet is created if the player clicks and they the control
        //variable used for the delay is false.
        bullet = this.physics.add.sprite(player.x, player.y, 'bulletImg');
        
        //moves the bullet away from the player in the angle that the mouse
        //pointer was from the player.
        this.physics.moveTo(bullet, this.input.mousePointer.worldX, this.input.mousePointer.worldY, 500)
        //rotates the bullet into the same direction that is travelling so it
        //appears like a real bullet
        bullet.rotation = Phaser.Math.Angle.Between(player.x, player.y, this.input.mousePointer.worldX, this.input.mousePointer.worldY) - 80

        //The control is set to true so that the player cannot fire again until
        //this is changed.
        control = true;
        //The control variable is set to false after a certain period of time.
        this.time.delayedCall(delay, function Bullet() {
            control = false;
        });
        //This adds a collider between the bullet and the world layer that
        //destroys the bullet when it collides.
        this.physics.add.collider(bullet, worldLayer, function destroyBullet(){
            bullet.destroy(bullet.x, bullet.y)
        })
    }
}
//...
```

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was fixing the issue with the angles because I did not know the phaser syntax for the coordinate positions in the world/map.

| 5    | Move around the map.                | The player should face the mouse where ever they are on the map.                        | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 6    | Press the mouse button.             | A bullet appears and is moving towards the mouse's position when the mouse was clicked. | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 7    | Shoot at the wall                   | The bullet should disappear.                                                            | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 8    | Hold down the mouse button.         | The bullets fire continuously but a delay between each time it is fired.                | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
| 9    | Achieve the ironGoal and then fire. | The delay should be shorter.                                                            | As expected.                                                            | Pass      |
