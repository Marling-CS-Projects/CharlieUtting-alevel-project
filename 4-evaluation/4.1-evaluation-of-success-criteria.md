| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | When was it achieved                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The map should have a bottom layer which has the road layout and other things that the player can walk over. This should have clear different parts to represent the road and make the setting of the game clear.                                               | [2.2.1-cycle-1.md](../design-and-development/2.2.1-cycle-1.md "mention")                                                                                                                |
| 2         | The second layer of the game will have things that are built on top of the floor and will mostly be made up of things that the player cannot pass through like walls. This should be noticeably different from the bottom layer so it is easy to differentiate. | [2.2.3-cycle-3.md](../design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3.md "mention")                                                                                                                |
| 3         | The final layers will be object layers that will consist of certain types of objects with different properties like bushes or iron.                                                                                                                             | [2.2.5-cycle-5.md](../design-and-development/2.2.5-cycle-5.md "mention")                                                                                                                |
| 4         | There will be 5 roads should be laid out to imitate the layout of a town.  Each road will have a different level of difficulty.                                                                                                                                 | [2.2.1-cycle-1.md](../design-and-development/2.2.1-cycle-1.md "mention")[2.2.10-cycle-10.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10.md "mention")                                    |
| 5         | The roads that are further from where the player will spawn will be harder to beat as there will be more zombies.                                                                                                                                               | [2.2.1-cycle-1.md](../design-and-development/2.2.1-cycle-1.md "mention")[2.2.10-cycle-10.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10.md "mention")                                    |
| 6         | The house that the player will spawn in will be their base.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <p><a data-mention href="../design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3.md">2.2.3-cycle-3.md</a><br><a data-mention href="../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md">2.2.9-cycle-9.md</a></p> |
| 7         | There will be two bosses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [2.2.10-cycle-10.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10.md "mention")                                                                                                            |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can see the roads in the background. The player, enemies and the objects overlay the background. The colours are different enough so the player can distinguish between the different parts of the map.

### Criterion 2

This is shown in the last picture. Again this you can see the brick texture against the other parts of the map. As you can see none of the other components of the game like the ones stated above are intersecting with this layer of the map. On the other hand I used similar colours for the grass and the bushes which makes it more difficult to distinguish between but it is still possible.

### Criterion 3

This is shown in the picture from criterion 1. This layer is the iron layer which can be interacted with and you can pick up. The bushes were not included in an option layer as I realised that it would not be necessary as they will behave in the same way as the the second layer.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/zombies.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is the map exported into an image from the map editor, Tiled, which shows the five different roads and the distribution of iron and the shapes of the different buildings which are created to imitate somewhat complex structures and to provide a challenge to the player.</p></figcaption></figure>

There are 5 different roads in the game and they do represent a road. The game also spawns a different amount of zombies on each of the roads to make the game more difficult.

### Criterion 5

This expands on the last criterion and clarifies the difficulty levels of the game. This was achieved and was touched on in the last criterion. To achieve this I made the coordinates of the roads have different densities of zombies spawning by increasing the rates of random spawning in between these coordinates. If I had more time I would have been able to more accurately spawned in the zombies using more ranges of coordinates to make the zombies spawn further from the player at the start when they begin the game.

### Criterion 6

This criterion is shown in the picture in criterion one as the player has not moved at this point in the game. The player does spawn inside a house. This house is chosen as it is small so it provides protection from the zombies and because it is at the start of the game. This house does not serve as the players base as I made a change in the play style of the game. This is that I intended that the game would have a complex crafting system which would have meant that the player would have to take time to use but I did not have enough time to implement the menus and the logic that I would have been needed.

### Criterion 7

This is the video that I used in Cycle 10 testing which shows the boss in the game.
{% endembed %}

This was completed as I added in the boss when the player finished collecting all of the iron in the game. There originally was meant to be two bosses which I could have easily added but I decided to take a different choice in my design as I felt that one boss at the end of the game was more fitting. If the game was more difficult and longer, then I think that a second boss would have complimented the experience but because of the length of the game I decided against it.
