| 1           | You are able to upgrade your weapon.                                                                                 | Success      |
| 2           | The materials you collect stand out.                                                                                 | Success      |
| 3           | The UI showing how much of a material you have and how much you need to upgrade will be has to be displayed clearly. | Success      |

### Feature 1

This was a complete success and is one of the core features of the game that drives the player to play the whole game. When you get a certain amount of iron your weapon will increase the amount of damage that it does and the rate that your weapon fires when you hold the left click button will increase.

### Feature 2

In the testing phase most people where able to identify the iron from the background even if they weren't able to identify what it was supposed to be. The colour of the floor in the houses is a dark brownish grey whereas the iron is a light grey which could be confused as part of the floor but because it is randomly distributed it is easy to realise that it is not a texture and is an object so the feature is overall a success.

### Feature 3

This is displayed in the top right corner of the game and this is displayed alongside the health and the player's coordinates. This is clearly visible as it is a bright red and it is in large characters. The text that I used cannot display a slash(/) so this had to be replaced with 'out of' so it still makes sense and is therefore a success.

| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                   | Fail         |
| 2           | Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions. | Success      |
| 3           | Have a clear explanation of the aim at the beginning of the game.                                 | Success      |

### Feature 1

There was no real menu system as the saving system was not particularly required due to the size of the game and it would have taken a lot of time which was used for more important features which made the game more enjoyable.

### Feature 2

The control system only has movement which is done with the arrow keys and left clicking which fires the gun. The other input that the game requires is for the player to move the mouse so that they can aim the gun. This is a very simple control system and means that you can keep your hands on the same controls to play the whole game as the items do not require you to press anything to collect it and is reliant on Phaser colliders meaning that it is collected when the player's sprite touches the iron object.

### Feature 3

At the beginning of the game there is a paragraph that is displayed which, among other things, tells you the aim of the game which is to collect all of the iron in the map whilst killing the zombies. After this aim is completed a boss is spawned in and this is the end of the game. To make the aim of the game more clear it could have been beneficial to have an end state of the game which showed the player that there was no content left in the game.
