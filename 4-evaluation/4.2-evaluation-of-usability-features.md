# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                          | Success/Fail |

| 1           | You are able to upgrade your weapon.                                                                                 | Success      |
| 2           | The materials you collect stand out.                                                                                 | Success      |
| 3           | The UI showing how much of a material you have and how much you need to upgrade will be has to be displayed clearly. | Success      |

### Feature 1

This was a complete success and is one of the core features of the game that drives the player to play the whole game. When you get a certain amount of iron your weapon will increase the amount of damage that it does and the rate that your weapon fires when you hold the left click button will increase.

### Feature 2

In the testing phase most people where able to identify the iron from the background even if they weren't able to identify what it was supposed to be. The colour of the floor in the houses is a dark brownish grey whereas the iron is a light grey which could be confused as part of the floor but because it is randomly distributed it is easy to realise that it is not a texture and is an object so the feature is overall a success.

### Feature 3

This is displayed in the top right corner of the game and this is displayed alongside the health and the player's coordinates. This is clearly visible as it is a bright red and it is in large characters. The text that I used cannot display a slash(/) so this had to be replaced with 'out of' so it still makes sense and is therefore a success.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                   | Fail         |
| 2           | Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions. | Success      |
| 3           | Have a clear explanation of the aim at the beginning of the game.                                 | Success      |

### Feature 1

There was no real menu system as the saving system was not particularly required due to the size of the game and it would have taken a lot of time which was used for more important features which made the game more enjoyable.

### Feature 2

The control system only has movement which is done with the arrow keys and left clicking which fires the gun. The other input that the game requires is for the player to move the mouse so that they can aim the gun. This is a very simple control system and means that you can keep your hands on the same controls to play the whole game as the items do not require you to press anything to collect it and is reliant on Phaser colliders meaning that it is collected when the player's sprite touches the iron object.

### Feature 3

At the beginning of the game there is a paragraph that is displayed which, among other things, tells you the aim of the game which is to collect all of the iron in the map whilst killing the zombies. After this aim is completed a boss is spawned in and this is the end of the game. To make the aim of the game more clear it could have been beneficial to have an end state of the game which showed the player that there was no content left in the game.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a series of roads that will act as levels to work through | Success      |
| 2           | Use difficulty as the game boundaries                            | Success/Fail |
| 3           | Incorporate a style of game art the suits the theme of the game  | Success      |

### Feature 1

This is started in one of the early development cycles and is mostly related to the map creation part. This is achieved because my game is laid out like a town and the levels are are determined by a snake like series of roads around the map. This is the only way to get around. The player is supposed to collect all of the iron in each of the roads which gives each one as an objective and therefore makes them a level meaning this is an overall success.

### Feature 2

This was mostly a success because the game gets progressively harder as the zombies have a higher spawn rate in the levels further from the spawn and this means that the player is not able to skip parts of the game(which I have tried) as they are overwhelmed by the zombies. On the other hand the map is a snake like structure using bushes meaning that the player cannot skip from the first level to the last quickly if they wanted but would ultimately fail. This was imposed on me because the zombies would move through the same route from later levels to where the player is now and this would ruin the experience so it was mostly successful because the player is not able to skip parts but the game has more boundaries than I would have wanted so it is only a success to an extent.

### Feature 3

This is achieved in my opinion and the majority opinion of the testing element of this project. The art that I created for the game uses dark colours that I discussed in the[1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention") section. For example the zombies were a green colour to promote disgust and the zombies clothing is dark blue which is supposed to provoke more negative feelings as this is what I was aiming for the player to feel about the enemies of the game which means that this feature is a success.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash                                             | Success      |
| 2           | The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | Fail         |

### Feature 1

This is evaluated in my testing section of my project and it is a success. No-one experienced the finished game crashing and it never really crashed even in development so this is a complete success.

### Feature 2

In testing I did identify some bugs that would change the course of how the player plays the game. For example is player is being idle in the game the zombies can push them through a wall. This is due to Phasers collision system and needs to be fixed. On the other hand most people did not experience many bugs but this is still a fail overall.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                                         | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a list of controls for the game                                              | Success      |
| 2           | Create an guide displayed in the game that helps players learn how to play the game | Success      |
| 3           | Have an abstracted control system with only essential controls in the game          | Success      |

### Feature 1

This is shown to the player in the same message as the aim of the game is explained. This being all in one message means that the tutorial is short and not overbearing and is easy to read due to it being only a few sentences. The controls are explained to the player briefly so this is an obvious success.

### Feature 2

This was previously addressed in the section above as the tutorial was explained all at once to the player. This outlines both the aims and controls and then explains how the player is able to upgrade their weapons so this is a success.

### Feature 3

The control system that is used is simple which is explained earlier in the section on simple controls. This is success is als evident due to the fact that the tutorial can be displayed in one message and that includes describing the controls so this is a success.
