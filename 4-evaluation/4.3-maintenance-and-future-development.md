# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Performance - The performance of the game as it grows in size will be very limited due to it being browser based.
* Enemies - Zombies are always following the player no matter how close they are.
* Length of Gameplay - The map is quite small as it only has 5 sections/levels and only 1 boss.
* Travelling - Traversing the map is difficult and repetitive.
* Crafting - There is only one material in the game and there is no choice on what you want to craft.
* Weapons - There should be more types of weapons like close range weapons.
* Menu and Saving - There is no menu when you start the game and the player cannot save their progress.

## Maintenance

The abiltity maintain a game is mostly reliant on the size of the game as if the game does not have many features then it is easier to maintain especially if you are just hosting it online but if I do add more features and make the game larger then it will be harder to maintain.

#### Current Size

To keep it at its current size the game I would need a short term development plan for the game that would fix the bugs that I found in testing. The limitations of the project that I listed above would not need to be developed. After that I would need to repeat the testing phase and to make sure that I have not caused more bugs. After this, because the game is finished, I would be able to host the website for public use. Also I would want to add support for WASD controls which was identified as a problem in my testing phase.

This project is extremely maintainable as all I would have to do is host the game for minimal costs due to it not making me any revenue and as long as the sight traffic was low enough. If the sight traffic increases then there may be more costs. The game is completely local so there are no security risks with online play.

#### Continued Growth

If I decided to add the features that I listed above I would both need to a short term development plan that I stated earlier and then I would need to make a plan to fix the current limitiations of the project that I listed above.

## Future Development

### Short Term

#### Bug Fixes

The first thing that I will need to address is the bugs in the game. The main bugs were

* A person can be pushed through the wall by the zombies(collisions)
* Bullets don't always disappear after they hit the wall if you are stood too far away(collisions)

### Long Term&#x20;

#### Addressing Limitations

describe aspects that could be developed to address the limitations identified earlier
