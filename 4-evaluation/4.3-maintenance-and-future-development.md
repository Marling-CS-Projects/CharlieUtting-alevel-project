# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Zombies can defy player's collision boundaries that are set by pushing them.
* Zombies are always following the player no matter how close they are.
* The map is quite small and has the ability to be longer to make the game more fun.
* The bullets don't always trigger their function after a collision(disappearing).
* The player cannot save their progress.

## Maintenance

This project is extremely maintainable as all I would have to do is host the game on a web server for minimal costs due to it not making me any revenue and as long as the sight traffic was low enough. The game is completely local so there are no security risks with online play.

## Future Development

### Short Term

#### Bug Fixes

The first thing that I will need to address is the bugs in the game. The main bugs were

* A person can be pushed through the wall by the zombies(collisions)
* Bullets don't always disappear after they hit the wall if you are stood too far away(collisions)

### Long Term&#x20;

#### Addressing Limitations

describe aspects that could be developed to address the limitations identified earlier
