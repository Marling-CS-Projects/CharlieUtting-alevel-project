# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

My success criteria contained 2 requirements in relation to the function and robustness of the game. Seeing as the development of the game is now halted due to the time constraints of the project, it is now an appropriate time to run these tests.

| Criterion | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 21        | It should be able to run smoothly without crashing. |
| 22        | It should perform well (have a high frame rates)    |

### Criterion 21

For this part of the testing I had to push the project to its limits with the purpose of stress testing the game. I did this by entering unusual inputs that I had not planned for like pressing random buttons that might have done something in the past or moving in places and directions that I did not intend. There were no bugs caused by this part of the testing and my code did what I expected. While doing these tests I did find some here were some bugs that could be used to exploit the game:

* The player could be pushed through the walls and bushes by the zombies and then could walk out the other side of the wall while the zombies were still stuck on the other side.
* When the player got the later gun upgrades the bullets would not disappear when they shot at a wall that was far away and the bullets would loose all of their speed.

### Criterion 22

To measure the frames per second of the game I used a library called stats.js which can be used to show the games current frame rate. The game consistently stays at 60fps which is double the amount that amount of frames per second than the amount that was required in the success criteria which means that it passed. I have included a picture below of the game after being played with the stats in the top left corner. The graph shows that it never dips below 60fps.
